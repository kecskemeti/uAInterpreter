; Substracts two 1 digit numbers as if they were scanned from the keyboard 
; Then prints the result on the top left corner of the screen 

; This sample shows features like:
; 1. Load numbers as text from memory (i.e., this could be the location a
;       where a keyboard scanner puts its results)
; 2. Convert single digit numbers from text to/form binary (e.g., ADC -48,A)
; 3. Print a single digit number to the top left corner (STC 0,A)

CONST in1 8
CONST in2 3 
entry:
LDC in1, A
; Memory contains the ASCII code of the number
; As if we have read it from the keyboard
SBC 48, A
LDC in2, B
SBC 48, B
; No subtraction operation!
; So we have to do a multiplication first
SBR B,A
ADC 48,A
; Printout to the display
STC 0,A
